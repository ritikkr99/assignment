## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ans- Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that has a wide variety of applications.
 All sorts of technological solutions have Python at their core, from web applications, search engines, 
and games to animation software and even other programming languages.

Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language.
 Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans- Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn’t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use.
 What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container.
 And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter.
 As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
ans- pros of Python
	1.Python is easy to learn and read
	2.Python enhances productivity
	3.Python has a vast collection of libraries
	4.Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
	5.Python is a portable programming language
     
    Cons of python
	1.Python has speed limitations
	2.Python is not so strong with mobile computing
	3.Python can have runtime errors
	4.Python consumes a lot of memory space
	5.Python is not easy to test


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
ans- We use python for the following domains:
	1.Data Science
	2.Automation
	3.Application Development
	4.AI&ML
	5.Audio & Video application
	6.Console Application
	7.Desktop GUI

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ans- Variable is containers which store values.

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
A variable name cannot start with a number.
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable. 

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ans- There are two methods:
	input ( prompt )
raw_input ( prompt )

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ans- By default in python , input returns a string.

Q8. What is type casting?
ans- Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.
 In this article, we will see the various technique for typecasting.

There can be two types of Type Casting in Python –

Implicit Type Casting
Explicit Type Casting



Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ans-The developer often wants a user to enter multiple values or inputs in one line. 
In C++/C user can take multiple inputs in one line using scanf but in Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 

Using split() method
Using List comprehension


Q10. What are keywords?
Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. 
example- and or for while

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
ans- We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
ans- 	Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. 
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ans- In Python, we can simply use the print() function to print output. For example,

print('Python is powerful')



Q14. What are operators in Python?
ans- Types of Python Operators
Here's a list of different types of Python operators that we will learn in this tutorial.

Arithmetic operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Special Operators


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
ans- These are the short hand operators for a=a/k and a=a//k respectively. 
The difference between these two is that a/k returns the floating point value of a/k (For eg. 7/2 returns 3.5) whereas,
 if you say 7//2, then, it returns only the quotient i.e. 7//2 returns 3.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
ans- for i in range(4):
  print('iNeuron',end='')	

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
ans-
x= int(input())

if (x%2)==0:
    print("even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")


Q18. What are boolean operator?

ans- The Python Boolean Type
The Python Boolean type has only two possible values:

True
False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
ans- 1. 1
	2. 0
	3. False
	4. 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
ans- Conditional Statement in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. 
Conditional statements are handled by IF statements in Python.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ans- It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for if is False , it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. 
If all the conditions are False , the body of else is executed.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

```
ans-
a = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
b = []

Q67. What is the use of values() function?
ans-
The values() method returns a view object. The view object contains the values of the dictionary, as a list. 

Q68. What are loops in Python?
ans-
A for loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. Such a type of statement is also known as an iterative statement.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
ans-
 In Python, there are two basic structures for defining loops:

while condition: 
    loop code block 
for something in iterable: 
    loop code block 
but for can also be used when creating a list, dictionary or set with (or by) comprehension

one_list = [x for x in interable] 
There are other specific functions to work with iterable

An iterable is any object that, within a loop, can deliver one element at a time, until all the elements are exhausted (or the loop is interrupted by a break statement).

Python includes several native iterables but the programmer can create their own by using specific instructions provided by the language.

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
ans-
 for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas execution is done in the while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
ans-Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block from after the continue statement

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
ans-
The break statement terminates the execution of the nearest enclosing do , for , switch , or while statement in which it appears.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
ans-
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
ans-
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
ans-
In this example, we are using the values() method to print all the values present in the dictionary.
# Python3 code to iterate through all values in a dictionary

statesAndCapitals = {
	'Gujarat': 'Gandhinagar',
	'Maharashtra': 'Mumbai',
	'Rajasthan': 'Jaipur',
	'Bihar': 'Patna'
}

print('List Of given capitals:\n')

# Iterating over values
for capital in statesAndCapitals.values():
	print(capital)
