Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
by using read.csv() function we load a csv file

Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans- using dtype attribute 

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
ans- here is a example 
Selecting all the rows from the given dataframe in which ‘Percentage’ is greater than 80 using basic method.

# importing pandas
import pandas as pd
  
record = {
  
 'Name': ['Ankit', 'Amit', 'Aishwarya', 'Priyanka', 'Priya', 'Shaurya' ],
 'Age': [21, 19, 20, 18, 17, 21],
 'Stream': ['Math', 'Commerce', 'Science', 'Math', 'Math', 'Science'],
 'Percentage': [88, 92, 95, 70, 65, 78] }
  
# create a dataframe
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(record, columns = ['Name', 'Age', 'Stream', 'Percentage'])
  
print("Given Dataframe :\n", dataframe) 
  
# selecting rows based on condition
rslt_df = dataframe[dataframe['Percentage'] > 80]
  
print('\nResult dataframe :\n', rslt_df)


Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
using the rename() function

Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
 drop() method is used to remove the columns from the DataFrame

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
You can get unique values in column (multiple columns) from pandas DataFrame using unique() or Series. unique() functions. unique() from Series is used to get unique values from a single column and the other one is used to get from multiple columns.

Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
using df.isna().sum().sum()

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
ans-
The fillna() function iterates through your dataset and fills all empty rows with a specified value. This could be the mean, median, modal, or any other value

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?
ans-
To concatenate an arbitrary number of pandas objects ( DataFrame or Series ), use concat.

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
ans-
You can join pandas Dataframes in much the same way as you join tables in SQL.
The concat() function can be used to concatenate two Dataframes by adding the rows of one to the other.
concat() can also combine Dataframes by columns but the merge() function is the preferred way.


Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
ans-
By “group by” we are referring to a process involving one or more of the following steps:

Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.

Applying a function to each group independently.

Combining the results into a data structure.

Out of these, the split step is the most straightforward. In fact, in many situations we may wish to split the data set into groups and do something with those groups. In the apply step, we might wish to do one of the following:

Aggregation: compute a summary statistic (or statistics) for each group.

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?
ans- using
DataFrame.pivot(self, index=None, columns=None, values=None)

Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
use pandas. to_numeric() 

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column?
ans-
use . sort_values() to sort the Panda DataFrames by a specific columns.

Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
by using copy() function 

Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?
ans-
by using loc function we can filter rows

Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans-
example if we want to take mean of specific column
then df.['column'].mean()


Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?

Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?

Q21. How do you select specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?

Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?

Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?
